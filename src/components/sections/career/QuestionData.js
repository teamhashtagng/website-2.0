        Almost none of the CX leaders we interviewed used CES as a relationship metric. And that’s appropriate. 

        CES was designed to be a transactional metric. The founders at CEB never intended for it 
        to be used to measure a relationship. Yet, the excitement around effortless experiences 
        leads many programs to try to force CES into that role.`
